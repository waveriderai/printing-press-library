# Linear CLI

**Offline-capable, agent-native Linear CLI with SQLite-backed sync, FTS5 search, cross-cycle comparison, project burndown projection, and a pp_created fixture-lifecycle contract that lets agents mutate real workspaces safely.**

Pulls your workspace into a local SQLite store with FTS5 search and runs compound queries that no live API call can answer in one round-trip — today view, bottleneck detection, project burndown, cycle comparison. Ships a thin linear_search + linear_execute MCP orchestration pair (with named multi-step intents for triage, standup, sprint plan, weekly update, and grooming) so agents reach the full surface in ~1K tokens instead of enumerating 60+ endpoint mirrors.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `linear-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-linear` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/project-management/linear/cmd/linear-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/linear-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-linear --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-linear --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install linear --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/linear-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `LINEAR_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "linear-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Linear personal API keys go in the `Authorization` header verbatim — no `Bearer` prefix. Run `linear-pp-cli auth set-token lin_api_yourkeyhere` to save your key (no Bearer prefix needed for Linear personal API keys), or export `LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...`. Personal API keys are workspace-scoped; the doctor command validates auth, API connectivity, and store health in one shot.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Save your Linear personal API key (or export LINEAR_API_KEY)
linear-pp-cli auth set-token <your-key>

# Burn your workspace into the local SQLite store for offline + transcendent queries
linear-pp-cli sync --full

# Your ranked work queue for today across every team
linear-pp-cli today --json

# Pre-sprint-planning overload + blocked-count signal for one team
linear-pp-cli bottleneck --team ENG

# Project landing date from regressed velocity, not the static target someone typed in
linear-pp-cli projects burndown PROJ_ID --weeks 8

# Archive only the test issues this CLI created in this session
linear-pp-cli pp-cleanup

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`today`** — See all of your assigned issues across every team for today, ranked by priority and cycle deadline.

  _Reach for this when an agent or human needs a single ranked work queue across every team, without naming the underlying joins._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli today --json --agent
  ```
- **`bottleneck`** — See which team members are overloaded and which issues are blocked before sprint planning.

  _Reach for this in sprint planning when you need to see who is overloaded and where work is stuck in one view._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli bottleneck --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`stale`** — Find issues that haven't been touched in N days, grouped by team and project.

  _Reach for this during backlog grooming when you need to surface forgotten issues without exhausting the API rate limit._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli stale --days 30 --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`similar`** — Find issues that look like duplicates of a query string using offline FTS5 fuzzy matching.

  _Reach for this during triage when you suspect an incoming bug duplicates an existing issue._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli similar "login redirect bug" --limit 5 --json
  ```

### Cross-entity rollups
- **`projects burndown`** — Project a project's landing date by linear-regressing remaining estimate against the team's measured velocity.

  _Reach for this when stakeholders ask when a project will land and the project page only shows a static target date someone typed in months ago._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli projects burndown PROJ_ID --weeks 8 --json
  ```
- **`cycles compare`** — Side-by-side metrics between any two cycles: completion %, scope added, scope cut, carryover, average cycle time.

  _Reach for this for cycle retros and Friday updates when you need a numeric diff rather than two browser tabs._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli cycles compare 42 43 --json
  ```
- **`slipped`** — Show what carried over from last cycle into this cycle, grouped by team and reason heuristic.

  _Reach for this in Friday stakeholder updates when you need a structured slipped-from-last-cycle list, not just a saved view._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli slipped --team ENG --json
  ```
- **`velocity`** — Track sprint completion rates over the last N cycles to spot productivity trends.

  _Reach for this in Monday sprint planning to ground rebalance decisions in actual completion data, not the team's last cycle alone._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli velocity --weeks 8 --json
  ```
- **`initiatives health`** — Rolled-up portfolio view per initiative: child project progress, milestone target-vs-projected dates, slippage flags.

  _Reach for this in portfolio reviews when stakeholders want the initiative-level rollup, not seven open project tabs._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli initiatives health --json
  ```
- **`milestones at-risk`** — List portfolio milestones whose projected landing date has slipped past their target, ranked by slip magnitude.

  _Reach for this in weekly portfolio review when the question is which milestone is most at risk, not which initiative is healthy._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli milestones at-risk --json
  ```

### Personal queues
- **`blocking`** — Show issues you are blocking — sorted by downstream impact (downstream count × downstream priority).

  _Reach for this every morning when you need to know which of your in-flight issues are stalling teammates downstream._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli blocking --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`pp-test list`** — List Linear issues this CLI created in the current or named session, then archive them with pp-cleanup.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs to clean up only the tickets it created in a session — the workspace's existing data must not be touched._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli pp-test list --json
  ```
- **`issues create --trust-mode strict`** — Refuse mutations on Linear issues not in the local pp_created ledger when --trust-mode strict is set; works on create and any future mutation surface.

  _Reach for this when running an agent against a real workspace with real data — strict mode makes accidental mutation impossible._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli issues create --title "Test ticket" --team ENG --trust-mode strict
  ```
- **Team-safe issue labels** — Discover labels that are valid for the target Linear team, including global labels, before creating or editing issues.

  _Reach for this before passing label UUIDs to `issues create` or `issues edit`; Linear rejects labels owned by another team, and the CLI now preflights label ownership before mutating._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli labels list --team ENG --agent --select id,name,global,team.key
  linear-pp-cli issues create --title "Title" --team ENG --label <global-or-eng-label-id> --agent
  ```
- **Shell-safe Linear writes with media** — Create and update issue descriptions, comments, and Linear docs without putting Markdown bodies on the shell command line.

  _Reach for this whenever a body contains newlines, quotes, backticks, `$()` expansions, shell commands, images, logs, or agent-generated Markdown._

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli issues create --title "Title" --team ENG --description-file /tmp/body.md --media /tmp/screenshot.png --agent
  linear-pp-cli issues edit ENG-123 --description-file /tmp/body.md --agent
  linear-pp-cli comments add --issue ENG-123 --body-file /tmp/comment.md --media /tmp/screenshot.png --agent
  linear-pp-cli documents create --title "Runbook" --issue ENG-123 --content-file /tmp/runbook.md --agent
  ```
- **Current issue reads and comments** — Read full issue bodies and discussion from live Linear when freshness matters.

  ```bash
  linear-pp-cli issues ENG-123 --agent --data-source live --select identifier,title,description,state.name,url
  linear-pp-cli comments list --issue ENG-123 --agent
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
linear-pp-cli attachments mock-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
linear-pp-cli attachments mock-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
linear-pp-cli attachments mock-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
linear-pp-cli attachments mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
linear-pp-cli attachments mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

Agent recipes:

```bash
# Full current issue body; compact output strips descriptions unless selected
linear-pp-cli issues ENG-123 --agent --data-source live --select identifier,title,description,state.name,url

# Safe multiline writes; body files preserve shell snippets literally
linear-pp-cli comments add --issue ENG-123 --body-file /tmp/comment.md --agent
```

## Health Check

```bash
linear-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/linear-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Freshness and Data Sources

Read commands fall into three categories with different data-source semantics. The persistent flags `--data-source auto|live|local` and `--max-age <duration>` control where reads come from and when to warn about stale local data.

| Category | Commands | Default | Override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Live-first with local fallback** | `attachments`, `projects get`, `teams`, `initiatives get`, `issues`, `issues list` (the v4 refactor) | `--data-source auto`: live API → write-through → fall back to local on network error | `--data-source live` (no fallback), `--data-source local` (no API) |
| **Snapshot-computational** | `today`, `bottleneck`, `blocking`, `similar`, `velocity`, `slipped`, `cycles compare`, `projects burndown`, `initiatives health`, `milestones at-risk` | Local store only — no live equivalent exists. **Must `sync` first.** | None (flag ignored) |
| **Label discovery** | `labels list --team ENG` | `--data-source auto`: reads live by default; `--data-source local` reads the synced `issue_labels` table | `--data-source live`, `--data-source local` |
| **Live collaboration reads** | `comments list`, `documents`, `documents list` | Always live; comments and working-session docs are collaboration surfaces where stale local state is misleading | n/a |
| **Mutations** | `issues create`, `issues edit`, `comments add`, `comments edit`, `documents create`, `documents edit`, `pp-cleanup` | Always live; on success, the HTTP cache is invalidated AND issue mutations are written back to the local store | n/a |

Promoted Linear GraphQL read commands such as `teams` and `projects get` use POST `/graphql` internally. They should not be reimplemented with shell-level GET calls; Linear rejects GET `/graphql` with CSRF/preflight errors.

**`--max-age` (default 30 minutes):**

When a store-backed read returns data older than `--max-age`, a stderr hint suggests running `sync`. Set `--max-age 6h` for archival workflows or `--max-age 0` to disable the warning entirely. JSON output stays clean — the hint is stderr-only.

**Cold-start hint:** Running `today`, `issues list`, `bottleneck`, etc. before any sync prints `(no issues in local store — run 'linear-pp-cli sync' to populate)` to stderr.

**Budget-conscious agent pattern (Linear meters ~1500 complexity points/hour on personal keys):**

```bash
# Hydrate once at session start
linear-pp-cli sync

# Read freely from local — zero API budget
linear-pp-cli today --data-source local
linear-pp-cli bottleneck --team ENG --data-source local
linear-pp-cli issues list --assignee me --data-source local

# Mutate — write-back keeps the store fresh, no re-sync needed
linear-pp-cli issues create --title "..." --team ENG --pp-session $SESSION

# Verify from local
linear-pp-cli issues list --data-source local --pp-session $SESSION

# Refresh every ~30 minutes for long sessions
linear-pp-cli sync
```

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `linear-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $LINEAR_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **Authentication failed / 401 from Linear** — Run `linear-pp-cli doctor` — it checks key validity, header shape (no Bearer prefix), and rate-limit headroom in one shot.
- **Rate limit error / complexity budget exceeded** — Lower concurrency on sync and prefer offline reads — Linear meters by complexity points (~1500/hr for personal API keys), mutations cost more than queries.
- **`sync --full` is slow or paginates indefinitely** — Run `linear-pp-cli sync` after the first full sync — it cursors on updatedAt and only fetches changed rows.
- **FTS5 search returns no rows for a term you know exists** — Run `linear-pp-cli sync` to refresh the FTS index, or `linear-pp-cli doctor` to confirm the FTS triggers fired on the latest sync.
- **Agent accidentally mutated an issue it did not create** — Set `LINEAR_PP_CLI_TRUST_MODE=strict` in the environment — strict mode refuses any mutation on an issue ID not in the local pp_created ledger.
