## Install

The recommended path installs both the `harris-teeter-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-harris-teeter` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/harris-teeter/cmd/harris-teeter-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/harris-teeter-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-harris-teeter --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-harris-teeter --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install harris-teeter --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

The bundle reuses your local browser session — set it up first if you haven't:

```bash
harris-teeter-pp-cli auth login --chrome
```

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/harris-teeter-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/harris-teeter/cmd/harris-teeter-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harris-teeter": {
      "command": "harris-teeter-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Authenticate

This CLI uses your browser session for authentication. Log in to .harristeeter.com in Chrome, then:

```bash
harris-teeter-pp-cli auth login --chrome
```

The CLI uses `pycookiecheat`, `cookies`, or `cookie-scoop-cli` when available. On this machine it can also fall back to the live Chrome session through `agent-browser`/`browser-use`, which matches the browser-sniff workflow used to create the CLI. If live browser fallback is unavailable, install one:

```bash
pip install pycookiecheat          # Python (recommended)
brew install barnardb/cookies/cookies  # Homebrew
```

When your session expires, run `auth login --chrome` again.

Product and coupon endpoints also require Harris Teeter's location/availability/fulfillment headers. The CLI defaults to the captured Beau Rivage Marketplace context (`location-id=09700096`, `facility-id=12956`). Override with `HARRIS_TEETER_LOCATION_ID`, `HARRIS_TEETER_FACILITY_ID`, `HARRIS_TEETER_MODALITY_TYPE`, or a full `HARRIS_TEETER_LAF_OBJECT` JSON value when using a different store.

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
harris-teeter-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
harris-teeter-pp-cli cart
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Browser-backed reachability
- **`auth login --chrome`** — Read Harris Teeter session cookies from the already logged-in Chrome session, falling back through agent-browser/browser-use when standalone cookie tools are missing.

  _Use this first when the CLI reports auth errors or a browser session has changed._

  ```bash
  harris-teeter-pp-cli auth login --chrome
  ```

### Store-context grocery reads
- **`products search`** — Search Harris Teeter products using the browser-observed Atlas search endpoint with location, fulfillment method, and LAF/modality headers.

  _Use this to inspect current store-specific grocery results from a terminal or agent workflow._

  ```bash
  harris-teeter-pp-cli products search --query milk --location-id 09700096 --page-size 5 --json --no-input
  ```
- **`products get`** — Fetch full product, offer, nutrition, inventory, and variant projections by UPC/GTIN through the logged-in Atlas product endpoint.

  _Use this when an agent needs exact item metadata without scraping a rendered product page._

  ```bash
  harris-teeter-pp-cli products get --upc 0007203673813 --json --no-input
  ```

### Account-aware savings
- **`coupons`** — List Harris Teeter digital coupons from the authenticated web endpoint, including optional UPC filtering.

  _Use this to check available savings before building a grocery list._

  ```bash
  harris-teeter-pp-cli coupons --page-size 5 --json --no-input
  ```
- **`cart`** — Inspect the authenticated Harris Teeter cart and shopping-list surfaces without exposing mutating checkout or order actions.

  _Use this when an agent needs to understand the current cart state without changing it._

  ```bash
  harris-teeter-pp-cli cart --json --no-input
  ```

harris-teeter-pp-cli cart

# JSON for scripting and agents
harris-teeter-pp-cli cart --json

# Filter to specific fields
harris-teeter-pp-cli cart --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
harris-teeter-pp-cli cart --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
harris-teeter-pp-cli cart --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
harris-teeter-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/harris-teeter-pp-cli/config.toml`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `harris-teeter-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

## HTTP Transport

This CLI uses Chrome-compatible HTTP transport for browser-facing endpoints. It does not require a resident browser process for normal API calls.
