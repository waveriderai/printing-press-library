# Benzinga CLI

**Every Benzinga calendar, news, fundamentals, and signal endpoint as a typed command — plus an offline SQLite store, full-text search, cross-entity queries, and the first Benzinga MCP server.**

Benzinga's licensed financial-data API is powerful but fragmented across ~60 endpoints and has only one complete client — a Python library with no CLI, no offline store, and no agent surface. This CLI covers the full documented REST surface as first-class commands, delta-syncs the calendar/news/signal families into a local database via the API's own updated cursors, and adds cross-entity commands the REST API cannot express in one call: watch a ticker set for overnight changes, explain why one name is moving, and rank analysts by accuracy.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `benzinga-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-benzinga` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/benzinga/cmd/benzinga-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/benzinga-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-benzinga --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-benzinga --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install benzinga --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/benzinga-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `BENZINGA_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/benzinga/cmd/benzinga-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "benzinga": {
      "command": "benzinga-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BENZINGA_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Benzinga uses a static API token passed as a query parameter. Set BENZINGA_API_KEY in your environment (or run benzinga-pp-cli auth set-token) and every command attaches it as ?token=. Access is tier-gated per product, so a valid token can still return 403 on an endpoint your plan does not include — that is a licensing boundary, not a CLI bug.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Confirm the binary and config resolve before adding a token.
benzinga-pp-cli doctor --dry-run

# Pull recent analyst rating changes for one ticker.
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-ratings --parameters-tickers AAPL

# Latest headlines for a ticker.
benzinga-pp-cli news get --tickers NVDA --display-output headline --page-size 10

# Build the local store so offline search and cross-entity commands work.
benzinga-pp-cli sync --resources calendar-ratings,calendar-earnings,news --since 7d

# See everything that changed on a watchlist since yesterday.
benzinga-pp-cli watch AAPL,NVDA,TSLA --since 24h --agent

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-entity local state
- **`watch`** — See everything that changed on your tickers since you last looked — new ratings, price-target moves, breaking news, and signals in one diff.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs a single 'what moved on my names' digest instead of fanning out across ratings, news, and signals endpoints._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli watch AAPL,NVDA,TSLA --since 24h --agent
  ```
- **`why`** — Build one time-ordered catalyst timeline for a ticker by merging unusual options, block trades, halts, rating changes, and news.

  _Use when the question is 'why is X moving right now' and the answer needs options + halts + ratings + headlines stitched in order._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli why NVDA --window 1d --agent
  ```
- **`catalysts`** — One forward-dated agenda per ticker set unioning earnings, dividends, splits, IPOs, FDA dates, conference calls, guidance, and offerings.

  _Reach for this to get every upcoming dated event on a watchlist in one ordered list rather than querying eight calendar endpoints._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli catalysts AAPL,LLY,MRNA --ahead 14d --agent
  ```
- **`insider-cluster`** — Flag tickers where several distinct members of Congress filed purchases within a window — cluster detection beyond a single disclosure.

  _Use to surface conviction signals where multiple unrelated members of Congress bought the same name, not just one routine filing._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli insider-cluster --window 30d --min 3 --agent
  ```

### Analyst signal quality
- **`analyst-accuracy`** — Rank rating-issuing firms and analysts by Benzinga's historical accuracy, and tag today's rating changes with the issuer's hit rate.

  _Use when an agent must judge whether a fresh upgrade/downgrade comes from an analyst with a real track record._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli analyst-accuracy --ticker AAPL --agent
  ```

### Earnings intelligence
- **`earnings-season`** — Compute EPS and revenue beat/miss and surprise % from the earnings calendar and link each name to its conference call and transcript.

  _Reach for this during earnings season to rank the week's reports by surprise magnitude with calls/transcripts attached._

  ```bash
  benzinga-pp-cli earnings-season --from 7d --agent --select ticker,eps_surprise_pct,beat
  ```

## Recipes

### Rank the week's earnings by surprise

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli earnings-season --from 7d --agent --select ticker,eps_surprise_pct,beat
```

Computes beat/miss and surprise % offline from synced earnings rows and projects just the decision fields.

### Explain a sudden move

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli why NVDA --window 1d --agent
```

Stitches unusual options, halts, rating changes, and news for NVDA into one chronological catalyst timeline.

### Morning watchlist diff

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli watch AAPL,NVDA,TSLA --since 24h --agent --select ticker,kind,headline
```

Cross-entity diff of ratings, news, and signals on a ticker set, narrowed to the most relevant nested fields with --select.

### Weekly US economic calendar

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-economics --country USA
```

Recent and latest macro releases for the US with actual vs consensus (country codes are 3-digit, e.g. USA).

### Vet a rating change

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli analyst-accuracy --ticker AAPL --today --agent
```

Ranks the firms/analysts issuing fresh AAPL ratings by their historical accuracy.

## Usage

Run `benzinga-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Paths & environment variables

This CLI separates local files into four path kinds:

| Kind | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config` | User-editable settings such as `config.toml` and saved profiles |
| `data` | Durable local data: `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, browser-session proof files, and other auth sidecars |
| `state` | Runtime state such as persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log` |
| `cache` | Regenerable HTTP/cache files |

Each kind resolves independently. The ladder is:

1. Per-kind env var: `BENZINGA_CONFIG_DIR`, `BENZINGA_DATA_DIR`, `BENZINGA_STATE_DIR`, or `BENZINGA_CACHE_DIR`
2. `--home <dir>` for this invocation
3. `BENZINGA_HOME` for a flat relocated root
4. XDG env vars: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
5. Platform defaults matching existing installs

For containers and agent sandboxes, prefer a single relocated root:

```bash
export BENZINGA_HOME=/srv/benzinga
benzinga-pp-cli doctor
```

Under `BENZINGA_HOME=/srv/benzinga`, the four dirs resolve to `/srv/benzinga/config`, `/srv/benzinga/data`, `/srv/benzinga/state`, and `/srv/benzinga/cache`.

MCP servers do not receive CLI flags from the host. Put relocation in the host `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "benzinga": {
      "command": "benzinga-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BENZINGA_HOME": "/srv/benzinga"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Precedence matters in fleets: an ambient per-kind variable such as `BENZINGA_DATA_DIR` overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `BENZINGA_HOME` or the per-kind variables for durable fleet relocation; treat `--home` as the weaker per-invocation lever.

Relocation is one-way. Unsetting `BENZINGA_HOME` does not move files back to platform defaults, and `doctor` cannot find credentials left under a former root. Move the files manually before unsetting relocation variables.

Existing installs keep working because the platform-default rung matches the legacy layout. On the first auth write, stored secrets leave `config.toml` and are consolidated into `credentials.toml` under the data directory. Run `benzinga-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to check path and credential-location warnings in automation.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-earnings

# JSON for scripting and agents
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-earnings --json

# Filter to specific fields
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-earnings --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-earnings --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
benzinga-pp-cli calendar get-earnings --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
benzinga-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Run `benzinga-pp-cli doctor` to see the resolved config, data, state, and cache directories. The platform-default config path is `~/.config/benzinga-pp-cli/config.toml`; `--home`, `BENZINGA_HOME`, and per-kind env vars can relocate it.

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BENZINGA_API_KEY` | per_call | No | Set to your API credential. |
| `CALENDAR_API_KEY` | per_call | No | Set to your API credential. |

### agentcookie (optional)

If you use agentcookie to sync secrets across machines, this CLI auto-adopts agentcookie-managed credentials with no extra setup. When the daemon writes to this CLI's config, `benzinga-pp-cli doctor` reports `agentcookie: detected` and `auth-status` labels the source as `agentcookie`. Skip this section if you don't use agentcookie - the CLI works the same as any other.

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `benzinga-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $BENZINGA_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **HTTP 403 on an endpoint that other commands hit fine** — Your token works but that product is not in your Benzinga plan; this is per-endpoint licensing, not an error. Use a product your tier covers or contact Benzinga sales.
- **HTTP 401 / auth_failed on every command** — The token is missing or invalid. Set BENZINGA_API_KEY=<key> or run benzinga-pp-cli auth set-token, then benzinga-pp-cli doctor.
- **watch / why / catalysts return nothing** — Those commands read the local store; run benzinga-pp-cli sync --resources ratings,news,earnings,option-activity --since 7d first.
- **Responses feel large or slow** — Narrow with --tickers and --date-from, and use --select to project only the fields you need (the docs recommend narrowing every query).

## Known Gaps

These reflect upstream Benzinga API state observed at build time (2026-06). The CLI issues correct requests, retries 5xx, and surfaces clear errors.

- **Earnings-call transcripts omitted.** The standalone `/api/v1/earnings-call-transcripts*` endpoints returned HTTP 503 ("failure to get a peer from the ring-balancer") across every token at build time — a Benzinga delivery-service outage with no healthy backend — so the `earnings-call-transcripts` commands were not shipped. The transcript *data* is also served from Benzinga's delivery API (`/api/v1/transcripts/calls`), which was healthy; a future build can add that source.
- **Operation ratios use the v2.1 endpoint.** The deprecated `/api/v2/fundamentals/operationRatios` path 500s upstream, so only **`fundamentals get-operation-ratios-v21`** (`/api/v2.1/...`, returns 200) is shipped.
- **Tokens are product-scoped.** A valid token can return 403 on a product not in your plan (a licensing boundary, not a bug). Set `BENZINGA_API_KEY` to a broad token for full coverage; market-data endpoints (bars, movers, quote, short interest, logos) require a market-data-licensed token.
