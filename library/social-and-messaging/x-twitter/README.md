# X (Twitter) CLI

**The only X CLI with an offline, searchable local mirror — full-text search and analytics over your archived posts without re-spending per-read API credits — plus a full-surface MCP server and honest tier/reachability diagnostics.**

Mirrors the official X v2 API and adds what no other X tool has: a local SQLite store you can sync once and query many times with FTS5 search and group-by analytics, agent-native --json/--select output, and an MCP server that exposes the whole surface to AI agents through token-efficient orchestration plus named multi-step intents. Start pasted-link workflows with `post resolve`, use `thread context` when a post needs parent/quote/reply context, save durable source material with `collection save/list/export`, track ongoing searches with `monitor create/run/list`, package saved activity with `brief`, snapshot accounts with `account snapshot`, find launch or repo links with `url mentions`, track post metrics with `performance snapshot/backfill/analyze`, export account/query timelines with `timeline export`, reconstruct synced conversation threads offline with `thread show`, compose self-reply threads from markdown with `thread compose`, author long-form X Articles from markdown with `articles-publish-md`, and rescue your bookmark graveyard with `users bookmarks find` — keyword and author search over your synced bookmarks, which X itself gives you no way to search.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `x-twitter-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-x-twitter` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x-twitter/cmd/x-twitter-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/x-twitter-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-x-twitter --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-x-twitter --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install x-twitter --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/x-twitter-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `X_BEARER_TOKEN` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/social-and-messaging/x-twitter/cmd/x-twitter-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x-twitter": {
      "command": "x-twitter-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "X_BEARER_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

X auth has three separate lanes. Run `x-twitter-pp-cli doctor --json` and inspect `auth_lanes` before choosing a command; do not assume one credential can stand in for another.

- `auth_lanes.app_only_api`: `X_BEARER_TOKEN`, the app-only bearer token from the X developer console. Use this for public reads such as post/user lookup, recent search, lists, and spaces.
- `auth_lanes.oauth2_user_context`: `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` or a stored OAuth2 access token. Required for `/2/users/me`, writes, bookmarks, personal reads, DMs, follows, likes, reposts, and user-context analytics. If this lane is missing or invalid, do not retry with `X_BEARER_TOKEN`; get a real OAuth2 authorization-code + PKCE user token and set/import it explicitly.
- `auth_lanes.x_articles_cookie`: logged-in x.com browser cookies captured by `x-twitter-pp-cli auth login --chrome`. This lane is only for X Articles / x.com browser-session endpoints. It does not create `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` and does not authenticate v2 API user-context commands.

Setup sequence:

1. Attach the app to a Project in the X developer console (`console.x.com`). Any environment, including Development, unlocks v2 API access; standalone-app tokens are rejected.
2. Set app permissions to Read and write when you need posting or other mutations.
3. Copy the app Bearer Token into `X_BEARER_TOKEN` for app-only public reads.
4. Enable OAuth2 with suitable scopes such as `tweet.read`, `tweet.write`, `users.read`, and `offline.access`, complete the authorization-code + PKCE flow, and set the resulting user-context token in `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN`.
5. Separately run `x-twitter-pp-cli auth login --chrome` only when using X Articles commands such as `articles-publish-md` or `articles ...` (needs `pycookiecheat` or `press-auth`; manual DevTools fallback is available).

A Development project does not limit the account; capability is set by app permissions and the account API tier. As of Feb 2026 X bills reads/writes per-use and restricts programmatic replies/quotes/@mentions; self-reply threads (`thread compose`) still work.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Health check first: confirms X_BEARER_TOKEN is set and reports what your token unlocks. One-time setup: export X_BEARER_TOKEN=... (get one at https://console.x.com/).
x-twitter-pp-cli doctor --dry-run

# Pull recent posts into the local SQLite store once, so later reads query locally instead of re-spending API credits.
x-twitter-pp-cli sync --resources tweets --since 7d

# Full-text search your archived posts entirely offline.
x-twitter-pp-cli search "launch" --type tweets --limit 20

# Aggregate your synced posts locally — e.g. top authors by post count — entirely offline, no API call.
x-twitter-pp-cli analytics --type tweets --group-by author_id --limit 10

# Resolve a pasted X URL into a canonical, agent-friendly record.
x-twitter-pp-cli post resolve https://x.com/user/status/123 --agent

# Save source material locally and export it later.
x-twitter-pp-cli collection save https://x.com/user/status/123 --collection research --note "Useful example" --agent
x-twitter-pp-cli collection export research --format markdown

# Track ongoing mentions with a local watermark and dedupe.
x-twitter-pp-cli monitor create launch --url https://example.com --agent
x-twitter-pp-cli monitor run launch --since last --agent

# Package saved activity without LLM-dependent claims.
x-twitter-pp-cli brief --monitor launch --since 24h --format markdown

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`post resolve`** — Normalize any X post URL or raw post ID into a canonical structured record. It prefers local data in auto mode, falls back to public v2 reads when needed, includes provenance (`live`, `local`, or `mixed`), and emits suggested next workflow commands.

  _Use this as the first command when an agent starts from a pasted X link. It avoids brittle URL parsing and returns stable fields for downstream workflows._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli post resolve https://x.com/user/status/123 --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli post resolve 123 --include author,media,links,refs,metrics --agent
  ```
- **`thread context`** — Resolve a post URL or ID, include parent and quoted posts when available, and optionally include bounded replies from the local store and/or recent search.

  _Use this before summarizing or drafting around a post. `thread show` is still the pure offline conversation reconstruction command; `thread context` is the URL-first workflow that can mix local and live data._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli thread context https://x.com/user/status/123 --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli thread context 123 --replies --depth 3 --limit 100 --agent
  ```
- **`collection save/list/export`** — Save resolved X posts into durable named local collections, then list or export them as markdown, JSON, JSONL, or CSV. This never writes to X; it only writes the local SQLite store.

  _Use collections for research libraries, launch mentions, examples, recruiting/source material, and anything an agent should reuse offline after the first API read._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli collection save https://x.com/user/status/123 --collection ai-agents --note "Good framing" --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli collection list ai-agents --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli collection export ai-agents --format markdown
  ```
- **`monitor create/run/list`** — Create named query, URL, or account monitors, then run them repeatedly with local watermarks and dedupe. `monitor create` and `monitor run` write only local SQLite state; they never post, like, reply, follow, or mutate X.

  _Use monitors for launch mentions, product/customer feedback, account tracking, and recurring agent jobs. `--since last` uses the saved watermark; `--preview` fetches without updating local state._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli monitor create ai-labs --query 'from:openai OR from:anthropic' --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli monitor create product-mentions --url https://example.com --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli monitor run ai-labs --since last --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli monitor list --agent
  ```
- **`brief`** — Build a deterministic source-backed JSON or markdown brief from monitor results, collections, or explicit post IDs. It packages links, authors, text, and available metrics; it does not invent conclusions or run LLM summarization.

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli brief --monitor ai-labs --since 24h --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli brief --collection launch-feedback --format markdown
  ```
- **`account snapshot`** — Capture profile basics, public metrics, pinned post, and recent posts for a username or user ID. It is read-only toward X and uses local data first unless `--live` or `--data-source live` is set.

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli account snapshot @username --recent 20 --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli account snapshot 12345 --include recent,profile,metrics,pinned --format markdown
  ```
- **`url mentions`** — Search for recent posts mentioning a URL, domain, repo, article, or product page. It can optionally save results into a local collection or create/update a local monitor for future runs.

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli url mentions https://example.com --since 7d --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli url mentions github.com/org/repo --collection launch-feedback --monitor repo-links --agent
  ```
- **`performance snapshot/backfill/analyze`** — Store timestamped post metrics locally, backfill recent account posts when auth allows, and analyze saved snapshots by type, hour, media, link presence, or label. Missing metrics stay nullable/absent; the CLI does not treat unavailable fields as zero.

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli performance snapshot --ids 123,456 --label 24h --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli performance backfill --mine --days 90 --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli performance analyze --since 90d --group-by type,hour,has_media,has_link --agent
  ```
- **`timeline export`** — Export an account or query timeline as markdown, JSON, or JSONL. Account exports use local synced tweets when available and fetch live only when needed or requested.

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli timeline export @username --since 30d --format markdown
  x-twitter-pp-cli timeline export --query 'ai agents' --since 7d --format jsonl
  ```
- **`thread show`** — Rebuild a full conversation thread from your locally synced posts — ordered and depth-tagged — without re-spending API read credits.

  _When an agent needs the shape of a discussion (who replied to whom, in order), reach for this instead of paginating the search API and re-assembling the tree by hand._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli thread show 1750000000000000000 --agent
  ```
- **`users bookmarks find`** — Search your synced bookmarks by keyword and/or author, offline. X has no bookmark search and its API exposes no bookmark timestamp, so bookmarks pile up unread; this rebuilds the missing retrieval layer from the local store. Read-only and free to re-run once synced — the X read credit is spent once at sync time, not per query.

  _The "I bookmarked something about this and can't find it" rescue. Sync bookmarks once, then let an agent retrieve and act on them (summarize, draft a thread, cluster) — the offline store is the agent's working set, not a per-query API spend._

  ```bash
  # one-time populate (personal read — needs X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN); add author field + users for --from
  x-twitter-pp-cli sync --resources bookmarks --param tweet.fields=author_id,created_at
  x-twitter-pp-cli sync --resources users

  x-twitter-pp-cli users bookmarks find "rust async" --agent
  x-twitter-pp-cli users bookmarks find "llm" --from @karpathy --limit 20 --agent
  ```

### Authoring workflows
- **`thread compose`** — Split a markdown file into a numbered, 280-char-packed self-reply thread; prints by default and only posts with --post.

  _Compose a thread from a document deterministically; the dry-run default lets an agent preview the exact tweets before any write._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli thread compose ./update.md
  ```
- **`articles-publish-md`** — Parse a markdown file with YAML frontmatter into the Draft.js content_state JSON X's Articles editor accepts; previews by default; --draft saves a draft, --post publishes publicly.

  _The only programmatic way to author a long-form X Article from a document; preview and --draft keep it private until you explicitly --post._

  ```bash
  x-twitter-pp-cli articles-publish-md ./post.md
  ```

## Recipes

### Archive a topic, then query it offline

```bash
x-twitter-pp-cli sync --resources tweets --since 24h && x-twitter-pp-cli search "ai agents" --type tweets --limit 50
```

Sync once into SQLite, then run as many offline FTS queries as you want without further API reads.

### Agent-friendly field projection on a large response

```bash
x-twitter-pp-cli search "openai" --type tweets --agent --select id,text,author_id,public_metrics.like_count
```

Posts carry large nested payloads; --agent + --select trims the response to just the fields an agent needs, keeping context cheap.

### Reconstruct a conversation thread offline

```bash
x-twitter-pp-cli thread show 1750000000000000000 --agent
```

Walks the synced posts joined on conversation_id and referenced_tweets into an ordered, depth-tagged tree — no API call.

### Compose a self-reply thread from a document (dry-run by default)

```bash
x-twitter-pp-cli thread compose ./release-notes.md
```

Splits the markdown into a numbered 280-char-packed self-reply thread and prints it; add --post to actually publish.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
x-twitter-pp-cli communities search --query example-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
x-twitter-pp-cli communities search --query example-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
x-twitter-pp-cli communities search --query example-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
x-twitter-pp-cli communities search --query example-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
x-twitter-pp-cli communities search --query example-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
x-twitter-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/x-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `X_BEARER_TOKEN` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |
| `X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN` | per_call | No | Set to your API credential. |

### agentcookie (optional)

If you use agentcookie to sync secrets across machines, this CLI auto-adopts agentcookie-managed credentials with no extra setup. When the daemon writes to this CLI's config, `x-twitter-pp-cli doctor` reports `agentcookie: detected` and `auth-status` labels the source as `agentcookie`. Skip this section if you don't use agentcookie - the CLI works the same as any other.

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `x-twitter-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $X_BEARER_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **403 with code 453 / "subset of X API v2 endpoints"** — Your app's access tier is below what the endpoint requires; check your tier in the X Developer Console (https://console.x.com/).
- **403 client-not-enrolled** — Your app is not attached to a Project. Attach it to a Project in the Developer Portal, then retry.
- **403 on a reply, quote-tweet, or @mention post** — X's Feb-2026 restriction blocks programmatic replies/quotes/cold mentions; use self-reply threads (thread compose) instead, which still post.
- **402 Payment Required** — Pay-per-use credit or spend limit exhausted; raise the limit or add credit in the Developer Console.
- **403 on a write or personal read with only a bearer token set** — App-only bearer tokens can't write or read 'me' data; set X_OAUTH2_USER_TOKEN for user-context operations.
