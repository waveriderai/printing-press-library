# Skool CLI

**Every Skool community feature, plus a local SQLite mirror, FTS, and cross-community ops no other Skool tool ships.**

Pulls every post, comment, member, course, lesson, and calendar event into a local SQLite store with FTS5 so you can query historical state, compute leaderboard deltas, and surface at-risk members the native UI cannot show. One auth_token cookie, two hosts (www.skool.com reads, api2.skool.com writes), zero CloudFront friction.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `skool-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-skool` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/skool/cmd/skool-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/skool-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-skool --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-skool --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install skool --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

The bundle reuses your local browser session — set it up first if you haven't:

```bash
skool-pp-cli auth login --chrome
```

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/skool-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/skool/cmd/skool-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skool": {
      "command": "skool-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

Skool has no public API. Authenticate with the auth_token JWT cookie from your logged-in browser session: `skool-pp-cli auth set-token` (writes ~/.config/skool-pp-cli/config.toml). Same cookie covers reads and writes; CloudFront requires a realistic User-Agent which the CLI sets automatically.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Paste your auth_token cookie value once; lives in TOML config
skool-pp-cli auth set-token

# First-time sync of the community into the local store
skool-pp-cli sync bewarethedefault

# List recent posts with field selection
skool-pp-cli posts list --limit 10 --json --select id,name,user.name

# Current 30-day leaderboard
skool-pp-cli leaderboard --type 30d --top 25

# Transcendence: members whose engagement velocity is dropping
skool-pp-cli members at-risk --weeks 4 --json

# What's new in the last day across the community
skool-pp-cli digest since 24h

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`posts top`** — Rank recent posts by upvotes, comments, or engagement and return them with full content.

  _Pick this for a daily/weekly cron that surfaces the 3-5 most-engaging posts from any community — perfect for catching up without scrolling._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli posts top --community earlyaidopters --since 7d --top 5 --by engagement --json
  ```
- **`leaderboard`** — Top members by points for the community, with level and bio fields included.

  _Pick this when an agent needs the current community leaderboard in one call without scraping the page._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli leaderboard --community bewarethedefault --top 25 --json
  ```
- **`digest since`** — Aggregate everything new across posts, comments, members, and lessons since a timestamp.

  _Pick this when an agent needs a single brief of community activity for a daily/weekly cron._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli digest since 24h --json
  ```
- **`sql`** — Run read-only SQL across every community in your local store.

  _Pick this when an agent needs to compose a query across multiple Skool communities you own or operate._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli sql 'SELECT community, COUNT(*) FROM posts GROUP BY community'
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`calendar export`** — Export upcoming community events to an .ics file for Google Cal / Outlook.

  _Pick this when a member wants community events on their personal calendar without manual entry._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli calendar export --ics > community.ics
  ```
- **`classroom export`** — Export an entire course to a markdown bundle (modules, lessons, attachments, video URLs).

  _Pick this when an agent needs to ingest a course for offline reference, search, or LLM retrieval._

  ```bash
  skool-pp-cli classroom export <course-slug> --out ./course/
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
skool-pp-cli calendar mock-value --community example-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
skool-pp-cli calendar mock-value --community example-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
skool-pp-cli calendar mock-value --community example-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
skool-pp-cli calendar mock-value --community example-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
skool-pp-cli calendar mock-value --community example-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Freshness

This CLI owns bounded freshness for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, covered commands check the local SQLite store before serving results; stale or missing resources trigger a bounded refresh, and refresh failures fall back to the existing local data with a warning. `--data-source local` never refreshes, and `--data-source live` reads the API without mutating the local store.

Set `SKOOL_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to disable the pre-read freshness hook while preserving the selected data source.

Covered command paths:
- `skool-pp-cli notifications`
- `skool-pp-cli notifications list`
- `skool-pp-cli notifications mark-read`

JSON outputs that use the generated provenance envelope include freshness metadata at `meta.freshness`. This metadata describes the freshness decision for the covered command path; it does not claim full historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

## Runtime Endpoint

This CLI resolves endpoint placeholders at runtime, so one installed binary can target different tenants or API versions without regeneration.

Endpoint environment variables:
- `SKOOL_COMMUNITY` resolves `{community}`
- `SKOOL_BUILDID` resolves `{buildId}`

Base URL: `https://www.skool.com`

## Health Check

```bash
skool-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/skool-pp-cli/config.toml`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `skool-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **404 on read endpoints** — Run `skool-pp-cli doctor`; the buildId likely rotated. The CLI auto-refetches but you can force `skool-pp-cli buildid refresh`.
- **403 from CloudFront** — Your auth_token expired or User-Agent is missing. Run `skool-pp-cli auth status` then `auth set-token` with a fresh cookie.
- **Empty leaderboard delta** — Need at least two snapshots. Run `skool-pp-cli sync` over multiple days, or `sync --snapshot-now` to seed two points.

## HTTP Transport

This CLI uses Chrome-compatible HTTP transport for browser-facing endpoints. It does not require a resident browser process for normal API calls.
