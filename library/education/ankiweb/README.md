# AnkiWeb CLI

**The only terminal-native way to search, rank, and download AnkiWeb shared decks — and read your cloud-synced decks — with an offline catalog no other Anki tool has.**

Every existing Anki CLI wraps the desktop AnkiConnect add-on; none touches ankiweb.net. AnkiWeb CLI talks directly to the website's service layer, decodes its protobuf responses, and keeps a local SQLite catalog so you can rank decks by approval rate, filter by audio coverage, compare candidates side by side, and watch for new decks since your last sync.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `ankiweb-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-ankiweb` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/education/ankiweb/cmd/ankiweb-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/ankiweb-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-ankiweb --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-ankiweb --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install ankiweb --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

The bundle reuses your local browser session — set it up first if you haven't:

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli auth login --chrome
```

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/ankiweb-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ankiweb": {
      "command": "ankiweb-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

AnkiWeb uses a session cookie, not an API key. Run `auth login --chrome` to import your logged-in ankiweb.net session, or set ANKIWEB_COOKIES. Public shared-deck search and info need no login.

The editor commands (`notetypes`, `notes add`) run on **ankiuser.net**, which AnkiWeb authenticates with a **separate** session cookie from ankiweb.net. Set it via `ANKIUSER_COOKIES` (or the config `ankiuser_cookies` key): open `https://ankiuser.net` while logged in and copy that domain's `ankiweb` cookie. The ankiweb.net cookie does not work for these commands (the editor returns HTTP 404).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search the public shared-deck catalog — no login needed.
ankiweb-pp-cli shared search spanish

# Rank results by approval rate to find the best deck.
ankiweb-pp-cli shared rank spanish --min-votes 20

# See full detail and reviews for one deck.
ankiweb-pp-cli shared info 241428882

# Import your ankiweb.net session for your own decks.
ankiweb-pp-cli auth login --chrome

# List your cloud-synced decks and card counts.
ankiweb-pp-cli decks list

```

## Known Gaps

- **`sync` command is a catalog-only sync** — `ankiweb-pp-cli sync` populates the local SQLite catalog with shared-deck data. Your personal card data (`cards search`, `decks list`) comes directly from AnkiWeb's live API on each call and is not cached locally. This is a structural limitation of AnkiWeb's API, which does not expose a bulk-export endpoint for personal card data.
- **`drift` command reports unsupported** — The `drift` command tracks download-count changes on decks you've published, but AnkiWeb's available endpoints do not expose per-owner download history. The command returns a clear `supported: false` response rather than fabricated data.
- **AnkiWeb rate limits unauthenticated shared-deck searches** — Repeated rapid searches against `/svc/shared/list-decks` trigger HTTP 429 with a "please log in" message. Run `ankiweb-pp-cli auth login --chrome` to use an authenticated session, or add a `--rate-limit 0.5` flag to slow requests.

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Catalog intelligence the website can't do
- **`shared rank`** — Rank shared decks by approval rate (upvotes vs downvotes) with a minimum-vote floor, instead of the raw vote counts the website shows.

  _Pick the highest-quality deck for a topic in one command instead of eyeballing vote counts deck by deck._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli shared rank spanish --min-votes 20 --agent
  ```
- **`shared search`** — Filter shared decks by whether they include audio or images, critical for language learners.

  _Surface only media-rich decks when audio matters (language study) without opening each deck._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli shared search japanese --has-audio --agent
  ```
- **`compare`** — Compare multiple shared decks in one table: approval rate, note count, audio/image coverage, and freshness.

  _Decide between near-duplicate decks at a glance instead of flipping between tabs._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli compare 241428882 815543631 --agent
  ```
- **`shared fresh`** — Rank or filter shared decks by last-modified date to surface actively maintained decks.

  _Avoid stale abandoned decks by finding the ones updated recently._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli shared fresh anatomy --since 2024-01-01 --agent
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`watch`** — Show shared decks that are new or changed for a search term since your last sync.

  _Re-run a weekly topic search and see only what's new instead of re-scanning the whole list._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli watch spanish --since-last-sync --agent
  ```
- **`drift`** — Track download-count changes on the decks you've published, between syncs.

  _See whether your published decks are gaining traction over time without manual note-taking._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli drift --agent
  ```
- **`brief`** — One digest for a topic: top decks by approval rate, audio coverage, the freshest deck, and how many are new since last sync.

  _Get a complete read on a topic's deck landscape in one call instead of running four commands._

  ```bash
  ankiweb-pp-cli brief spanish --agent
  ```

## Recipes

### Find the best audio-rich Spanish deck

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli shared rank spanish --has-audio --min-votes 20 --agent --select decks.title,decks.approval,decks.notes
```

Ranks audio-bearing Spanish decks by approval rate and narrows the JSON to just title, approval, and note count.

### Compare three anatomy decks

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli compare 241428882 815543631 1713698257 --agent
```

One table of approval rate, notes, audio/image coverage, and freshness across the three deck ids.

### What anatomy decks are new this week

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli watch anatomy --since-last-sync --agent
```

Diffs the current catalog against your last sync and lists only new or changed decks.

### Topic briefing

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli brief japanese --agent
```

Top decks by approval, audio coverage percentage, the freshest deck, and new-since-sync count in one digest.

## Usage

Run `ankiweb-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### decks

Your cloud-synced decks and study stats (requires AnkiWeb login)

- **`ankiweb-pp-cli decks`** - List your synced decks with card counts and study stats (protobuf response; 200 with session cookie, 403 without)

### shared

Browse, search, and download public shared decks (no login required)

- **`ankiweb-pp-cli shared download`** - Download a shared deck .apkg. NOTE: requires a signed ?t= token minted client-side (op=sdd); without it the endpoint returns 400/503.
- **`ankiweb-pp-cli shared info`** - Full detail + reviews for one shared deck (protobuf response)
- **`ankiweb-pp-cli shared search`** - Search the shared-deck catalog by keyword (protobuf response)

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
ankiweb-pp-cli decks

# JSON for scripting and agents
ankiweb-pp-cli decks --json

# Filter to specific fields
ankiweb-pp-cli decks --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
ankiweb-pp-cli decks --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
ankiweb-pp-cli decks --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
ankiweb-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/ankiweb-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ANKIWEB_COOKIES` | per_call | Yes | ankiweb.net session cookie (`ankiweb=…`). Used by all commands except the editor. |
| `ANKIUSER_COOKIES` | per_call | For editor | ankiuser.net session cookie, required by `notetypes` and `notes add`. Distinct from `ANKIWEB_COOKIES`. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `ankiweb-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $ANKIWEB_COOKIES`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **decks list returns 403 / not authenticated** — Run `ankiweb-pp-cli auth login --chrome` to import your ankiweb.net session cookie, or set ANKIWEB_COOKIES.
- **notetypes / notes add say "no ankiuser.net session cookie configured"** — These run on ankiuser.net, which needs a separate cookie. Open `https://ankiuser.net` while logged in, copy that domain's `ankiweb` cookie, and set `ANKIUSER_COOKIES='ankiweb=…'`.
- **shared download fails with a token error** — Deck download requires a signed token AnkiWeb mints in-browser; this is a known limitation — download the deck from ankiweb.net directly for now.
- **search returns nothing** — An empty search term returns no results; provide a keyword, e.g. `shared search spanish`.

## Discovery Signals

This CLI was generated with browser-captured traffic analysis.
- Target observed: https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks
- Capture coverage: 5 API entries from 6 total network entries
- Reachability: standard_http (85% confidence)
- Protocols: protobuf (95% confidence), sveltekit_spa (90% confidence)
- Auth signals: cookie — cookies: has_auth
- Generation hints: protobuf_responses_require_handwritten_decoders, cookie_auth_validated, download_requires_signed_token
- Candidate command ideas: search — GET /svc/shared/list-decks?search= returns repeated deck protobuf {id,title,upvotes,downvotes,modified,notes,audio,images}; info — GET /svc/shared/item-info?sharedId= returns full deck detail + reviews protobuf; download — GET /svc/shared/download-deck/{id}?t= requires client-minted signed token (op=sdd); token generation unresolved; list — POST /svc/decks/deck-list-info returns user's synced decks; cookie-gated

Warnings from discovery:
- : All API responses are protobuf, not JSON; generated JSON decoding will not work without hand-written wire-format readers.
- : Shared-deck download needs a signed ?t= token minted by AnkiWeb client JS; not reproducible from captured traffic alone.
